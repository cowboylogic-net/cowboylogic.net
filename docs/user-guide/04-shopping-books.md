# 04 Shopping for Books

Use this section to browse books, open details, and add items to your cart.

## Task: Open the book store

1. Open `<SITE_URL>`.
2. Desktop: click `CLP Book Store` in the top navigation (or open it from the footer).
3. Mobile: open the burger menu and tap `Bookstore` (you can also open it from the footer).

What you should see:

- A list of book cards.
- Each card shows the book title, format (for example `PAPERBACK`), price, and stock state.

If it doesn't work:

- Refresh the page once.
- Try opening the store from the footer instead of the menu.

## Task: Sort the book list

1. On the store page, open the `Sort by` dropdown.
2. Choose one of the options (examples seen in UI): `Newest`, `Oldest`, `Title A → Z`, `Price: low to high`, `Price: high to low`, `Custom display order`.

What you should see:

- The list order updates based on the selected option.

If it doesn't work:

- Select another option and switch back.

## Task: Open a book details page

1. In the store list, click the **book title** on a card.

What you should see:

- A details page with book information (title, description, format, price, stock).

If it doesn't work:

- Go back and click a different title.
- Refresh the page and try again.

## Task: Add a book to cart

Where the button exists:

- On the **book card** in the store list.
- On the **book details** page.

1. Click `Add to cart`.

What you should see:

- The item is added to your cart.

Guest vs signed-in behavior:

- Guests can add items to a **guest cart**.
- In the cart, guests will see a prompt to **log in or register** instead of a checkout button.

If it doesn't work:

- If the book is out of stock, you can’t add it (see the next task).

## Task: Understand “Out of stock” behavior

1. If a book has `Out of stock` status, open its card or details page.

What you should see:

- `Out of stock` text.
- The action button is disabled and shows `Out of stock` (instead of `Add to cart`).

## Task: Buy Kindle books on Amazon

1. Open a book that is marked as Kindle (`Kindle (Amazon)`).
2. Click `Buy on Amazon`.

What you should see:

- Amazon opens in a **new browser tab**.

If it doesn't work:

- Try again from the book details page.
- If there is no `Buy on Amazon` button, the title is not a Kindle (Amazon) book.
