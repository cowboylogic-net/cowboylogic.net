# 02) Getting Access

This section explains how to get access and choose the right account type.

---

## Before you start (recommended)

1. Make sure you can receive emails at the address you will register with.
2. If you use Gmail/Outlook, be ready to check **Spam/Junk** for verification codes.
3. Keep your email inbox open while you register (it helps to avoid missing the code).
4. Your **role is attached to your email address**. If the role changes later, you must log out and log in again.

## Important access rules

- You can self-register as a **User** (regular account).
- You can self-register as a **Partner** (business/partner account) using the partner option during registration.
- **Admin access is NOT available during registration.**
- Admin access can be granted only by an existing **Admin** or **Super Admin**:
  - in the website admin area (if available): `Admin Dashboard` → `User Management`, or
  - by the internal team (for example, controlled database update).

If you are not sure what you need:

- Ask your manager, or contact `<SUPPORT_EMAIL>`.

## Task: Decide which account type you need

1. Choose **User** if you only need to browse and buy books.
2. Choose **Partner** if you need partner pricing and partner purchase rules.
3. Choose **Admin** only if you manage the website (books, users, newsletters, content pages).

What you should see:

- You understand which option to choose before registering.

If it doesn’t work:

- Ask your manager which access you need.
- Contact `<SUPPORT_EMAIL>`.

## Task: Request Admin access (cannot be done through registration)

   - Log out
   - Close the browser tab
   - Open `<SITE_URL>` again
   - Log in again

What you should see:

If it doesn’t work:

- Ask the Admin/Super Admin to confirm your role was updated for the correct email.
- Make sure you logged in with the same email that was updated.
- Log out and log in again (role changes are not always visible until a new login session starts).
